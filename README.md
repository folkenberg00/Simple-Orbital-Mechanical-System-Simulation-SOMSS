# Simple-Orbital-Mechanical-System-Simulation-SOMSS
Have you ever wondered: 1) what keeps a space vehicle like an artificial satellite in orbit? 2) Why at an altitude of 36,000 km above the Earth's surface, we can constantly monitor phenomena of interest like weather patterns on a specific hemisphere ? 3) What happens to the satellite's orbital velocity at the point nearest(perigee) and farthest(apogee) to the earth's center mass from its orbit? This simple program answers these questions. It takes into account Kepler's laws of planetary motion and the universal law of gravitation to visually demonstrate what would happen to one of two interacting masses, say an artificial satellite in the event parameters such as orbital velocity, orbital radius, orbiting mass and orbital period are changed. 

===================== REQUIRED MODULES ==========================

To run this program you require Python 3 IDLE and the following modules installed:
  1. numpy
  2. matplotlib
  3. tkinter
  
==================== ATTACHED FILES =============================
1. sample simulation results(sim.results.pdf)
2. short video(demo.m4v)

N/B: This is an incomplete but quite useful program in understanding some of the basic concepts mentioned above in orbital mechanics. Certain functionalities like 3D rendition haven't been implemented yet, but it serves its originally intended purposes well.
